# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is a cross-platform mobile app built using React Native, TypeScript, and Expo that helps parents teach their toddlers and young children how to read. The app is inspired by the principles from "How to Teach Your Baby to Read" by Glenn Doman and is designed to offer daily reading sessions through a card-based interface. Parents can conduct between three and fifteen sessions a day, each featuring large, clear word cards with a simple tap navigation. By combining playful design with an educational purpose, the app provides a guided experience that encourages a daily learning routine and tracks progress over time. Key components include a welcoming home screen, an engaging card display for reading sessions, an onboarding tutorial, settings for customization, and progress tracking tools. The focus is always on a child-friendly interface that simplifies the process of learning to read while ensuring parents have complete control over the settings and scheduling.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user launches the app, they are first welcomed with a clean and friendly welcome screen that introduces the app’s purpose and overall look. Even though the app does not require a formal account creation process at this stage, parents are guided through a comprehensive onboarding tutorial that explains the core features. This tutorial is presented as a series of short, swipable slides and can be navigated at the user's own pace or skipped entirely for a quicker entry into the app. For future updates, if a sign-in or account creation feature is introduced to allow for cloud syncing and multi-device support, the process will be simple and accessible via email or social login, and options for password recovery will be clearly available. For now, the app uses local storage, and there is no formal sign-in, ensuring that the user experience remains straightforward and focused on immediate educational value.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After completing or skipping the onboarding tutorial, the user lands on the Home Screen, which serves as the main dashboard. This screen welcomes the user with a motivational message to encourage daily reading and features a prominent “Start Session” button that makes beginning a reading session both simple and intuitive. The layout is clean and minimalistic with clear typography and the use of soft, accent colors that create a child-friendly atmosphere. At the bottom of the screen, a navigation bar provides quick access to other major parts of the app, including a progress tracking section that displays charts and statistics, and a settings screen where adjustments can be made to session frequency, custom word additions, and other preferences. There is also a hamburger menu located in the top-right corner that gives access to additional pages like the card display screen and a re-accessible tutorial.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the “Start Session” button is tapped on the Home Screen, the app navigates to the Card Display Screen. This page is dedicated solely to the reading session where each word is displayed on individual cards with large, red text. The design supports simple tap interactions; parents can tap on on-screen arrows or the edges of the screen to navigate through the cards. As the session progresses, the app silently runs a card replacement algorithm in the background. When the session begins, if it is the initial phase of a new card set, the original five cards remain for five days to build familiarity. After this period, starting from day six, one randomly selected original card is replaced per day until every card has been updated, after which each card continues on a five-day lifecycle before being replaced. As sessions are conducted, the app updates a local session log and, if the daily target of three sessions is not met, the system schedules native in-app notifications to remind the parent to complete any missed sessions.

From the Card Display Screen, the user may finish the session, triggering the system to update the session log stored locally. If necessary, the user can return to the Home Screen or navigate to the Progress Tracking Screen using the bottom tab bar. This progress page displays data such as daily or weekly session counts, streaks, and word replacement progress. Navigation between features is designed to be seamless and intuitive. The app ensures that parents can move from one core feature to another without confusion, whether they are switching from a reading session to adjusting settings or simply reviewing progress.

## Settings and Account Management

The Settings Screen is designed to offer parents a simple yet effective means to customize the experience. From this page, parents can adjust the number and frequency of daily sessions, set preferences related to the card replacement pace, and add or modify custom words. They can also choose the display language for the word cards, tailoring the learning experience to their preferences. Although there is no traditional account management process involving user authentication at this early stage, the settings page functions as the place where all personal configurations are managed. After updates are made in the Settings Screen, users can easily return to the main dashboard via the persistent navigation bar. This ensures that any changes or customizations are immediately reflected in the overall app experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The app is built with thorough error handling to ensure that users can easily recover from any unexpected issues. If the user enters invalid data while adjusting settings, such as entering an incorrect custom word format or setting a non-numeric value for session frequency, clear and friendly error messages are displayed directly on the respective screens. In cases of connectivity issues, while core features continue to work in offline mode, any attempt to access optional cloud features or updates will show a fallback message indicating that an internet connection is required. When users try to perform actions that are not permitted, such as initiating a session when the daily target has already been met, the app informs them of the current state and offers suggestions for how to proceed. This design ensures that regardless of the error or alternate user action, the transition back to the normal workflow is smooth and straightforward.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The journey throughout the app is focused on simplicity and continuity. A new user begins with a welcoming introduction and a clear onboarding tutorial that explains the basic functionality. Once on the Home Screen, the parent is invited to initiate a reading session through a simple tap interface that leads to the interactive Card Display Screen. During the session, the card replacement algorithm runs in the background, ensuring that the content adapts over time to the child's learning progression. Session notifications help maintain consistency by reminding parents if the daily target is not met. At any point, the user can adjust their settings or review progress using the clearly defined navigation options. The entire process is designed to be as intuitive as possible, ensuring that parents spend less time managing the technology and more time engaging with their child’s learning journey. This well-connected flow from onboarding to daily use provides a complete roadmap of the app, making sure that every action and page is linked in a natural, user-friendly manner.
