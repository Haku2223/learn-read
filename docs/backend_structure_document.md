# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

The backend of our reading app plays a vital role in handling data, processing logic, and supporting future enhancements. While the primary interaction happens on the mobile device, the backend is designed to manage session data, card sets, and user settings, ensuring that the app remains responsive whether used offline or connected to an optional cloud service. This document outlines the planning and architecture of our backend system, keeping in mind that the current focus is on offline-first data storage with an eventual upgrade to cloud syncing, all while ensuring the system is secure, maintainable, and scalable for growing user demands.

## Backend Architecture

Our backend architecture is designed with simplicity and future growth in mind. Initially, the system relies on local data storage solutions such as AsyncStorage, with a planned upgrade to SQLite if the need for more complex data relationships arises. The design follows modern best practices with a clear separation of concerns: business logic, data management, and API integrations are all kept modular. This approach not only makes the system easy to maintain but also prepares it for an eventual transition to cloud-based backend services like Supabase or Firebase. This modular design guarantees that components can be updated or replaced individually, without impacting the overall performance of the system.

## Database Management

The current backend data management strategy uses local storage to keep things simple and fast. For quick access and offline usage, data such as session logs, card sets, and user settings are stored using AsyncStorage. As the app evolves and local data handling becomes more complex, we are poised to integrate SQLite, which offers a more robust solution for managing relational data. In the long term, if a need for syncing across multiple devices arises, our plans include transitioning to cloud-based database solutions offered by services like Supabase or Firebase. This layered approach means that data is organized efficiently, stored securely, and can be accessed swiftly, even when the internet is not available.

## API Design and Endpoints

While the initial implementation of the app focuses on offline functionality, it has been designed with API integration in mind for future enhancements. Our API design follows a RESTful approach, using clear and consistent endpoints that communicate effectively with the frontend. These endpoints would handle tasks such as fetching session logs, updating card sets, and managing user settings. For example, one endpoint might start a new reading session by logging the current state, while another handles the synchronization of data with a cloud service when connectivity is available. This planned structure ensures that each endpoint has a single responsibility and the data flow between the frontend and backend remains transparent and efficient.

## Hosting Solutions

In our current setup, the focus is on local device storage using the mobile platformâ€™s built-in capabilities. However, as we plan for future growth and potential cloud syncing, our hosting strategy is geared towards reliable and scalable cloud services. Providers like Firebase or Supabase are strong candidates because they offer managed backend services that reduce the overhead of server maintenance, offer built-in security measures, and support rapid scaling as the user base grows. This future-proof approach guarantees that once our app needs real-time data synchronization and user authentication, the transition to a cloud hosting environment will be smooth and seamless.

## Infrastructure Components

The backend infrastructure is built with several key components to ensure a smooth operation and excellent performance. Even though the current implementation is offline-focused, the design includes areas for expansion, such as load balancing, caching, and content delivery. For instance, when cloud syncing is implemented, load balancers will distribute network requests to avoid overload on any single server. Caching mechanisms will be used to store frequently accessed data locally, reducing latency and improving the user experience. Although content delivery networks (CDNs) are more relevant to media-heavy applications, the readiness to integrate such components means we are prepared for any future growth in data volume or user engagement.

## Security Measures

Security has been integrated into every layer of our backend design. Data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS protocols and, as we move towards a cloud solution, databases will be configured to store data securely with encryption at rest. With sensitive information, especially data related to children, strict measures will be implemented to comply with regulations like COPPA and GDPR-K. Secure authentication methods, including OAuth or strong email/password strategies with robust hashing, are planned to protect user accounts. Additionally, parental controls and transparent data-handling practices ensure that all stored data is used only for its intended purpose and complies with data privacy laws.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that the backend continues to operate smoothly, we have built-in monitoring and maintenance strategies. Monitoring tools will track system performance, record error logs, and manage resource usage to identify issues before they impact the user experience. Regular audits of security settings, performance benchmarks, and data integrity checks will be carried out to keep the system reliable. Maintenance tasks will be automated where possible, such as routine updates, cleanup of old session logs, and timely replacements of expired data. This proactive approach ensures that the backend remains secure, efficient, and up-to-date over the lifecycle of the app.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, our backend structure is thoughtfully designed to balance simplicity, performance, and future scalability. With an offline-first approach using AsyncStorage, a clear path to leveraging SQLite or cloud solutions, and modular RESTful API endpoints planned for future use, the backend is robust yet flexible. The chosen hosting environments, whether local storage or cloud providers like Firebase, combined with comprehensive security measures and a proactive maintenance plan, ensure that the system meets the project's goals. This setup not only supports the current needs of daily reading sessions and user customization but also lays a strong foundation for future development, making our app both unique and resilient in a rapidly changing technological landscape.
